When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it's not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers \u2014 but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It\u2019s not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or-determined students away."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that's become popular for adults looking for a career change.

For instance, one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "The students in the Flatiron class probably won\u2019t drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the \u201cRuby on Rails\u201d language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn \u2014 how to think logically through a problem and organize the results \u2014 apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers \u2014 in their pockets, in their offices, in their homes \u2014 for the rest of their lives.

The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat. USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress.
