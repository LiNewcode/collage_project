In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother's attention. \u201cParents don\u2019t have to be exquisitely present at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need,\u201d says Radesky.

After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn\u2019t it?

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once. This isn't surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game.
