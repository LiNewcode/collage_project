The main purpose of this “clawback” rule is to hold bankers accountable for harmful risk-taking and to restore public trust in financial institution.

For public institutions, state funds are sometimes tied partly to their success on metrics such as graduation rates and student retention—so better grades can, by boosting figures like those, mean more money. And anything that raises GPAs will likely make students-who, at the end of the day are paying the bill—feel they’ve gotten a better value for their tuition dollars, which is another big concern for colleges."

On this, students' and colleges’ incentives seem to be aligned."
