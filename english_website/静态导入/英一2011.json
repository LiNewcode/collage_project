For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. \u201cHooray! At last!\u201d wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert\u2019s appointment in the Times, calls him \u201can unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him.\u201d As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint praise."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. There recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today's live performances; moreover, they can be \u201cconsumed\u201d at a time and place of the listener\u2019s choosing. The widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert's own interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic into \u201ca markedly different, more vibrant organization.\u201d But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra's repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America\u2019s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hops to attract."}], "XiaoTiCount": "5", "BigSbjId": "238664", "SbjSubContentList": [{"SbjId": "1764817", "SbjType": "1", "Score": "0", "SbjNanDu": "0", "QuanZhanZuoDa": "2", "QuanZhanRightRate": "50.00", "YiCuoXiang": "", "LastAnswer": "", "SbjContentList": [{"QType": "1", "QContent": "21.

For earned media, such marketers act as the initiator for users' responses. But in some cases, one marketer's owned media become another marketer's paid media \u2013 for instance, when an e-commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce engines within that environment. This trend, which we believe is still in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies\u2019 marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways.

You can, Mr Menand points out, became a lawyer in three years and a medical doctor in four. But the regular time it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities is nine years. Not surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out before getting their degrees."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "[B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: Literature, languages, philosophy and so on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 22% of American college graduates now major in business compared with only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many leading American universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic canon of ideas that every educated person should posses. But most find it difficult to agree on what a \u201cgeneral education\u201d should look like. At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, \u201cthe great books are read because they have been read\u201d-they form a sort of social glue."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "[C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with professorships for which they entered graduate school. There are simply too few posts. This is partly because universities continue to produce ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study humanities subjects: English departments awarded more bachelor's degrees in 1970-71 than they did 20 years later. Fewer students requires fewer teachers. So, at the end of a decade of theses-writing, many humanities students leave the profession to do something for which they have not been trained."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "[D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is that they can cut across the insistence by top American universities that liberal-arts educations and professional education should be kept separate, taught in different schools.

Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in law, medicine or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-specialist liberal-arts degree before embarking on a professional qualification."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "[E] Besides professionalizing the professions by this separation, top American universities have professionalized the professor. The growth in public money for academic research has speeded the process: federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960and 1990, but faculty teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for a successful academic career: as late as 1969 a third of American professors did not possess one. But the key idea behind professionalization, argues Mr Menand, is that \u201cthe knowledge and skills needed for a particular specialization are transmissible but not transferable.\u201d So disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the production of knowledge, but also over the production of the producers of knowledge."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "[F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is to alter the way in which \u201cthe producers of knowledge are produced.\u201d Otherwise, academics will continue to think dangerously alike, increasingly detached from the societies which they study, investigate and criticize.\u201d Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, may need to become less exclusionary and more holistic.\u201d Yet quite how that happens, Mr Menand dose not say."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "[G] The subtle and intelligent little book The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University should be read by every student thinking of applying to take a doctoral degree.
