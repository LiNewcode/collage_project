Firstly\uff0cwith the maturity of the students, most parents tend to support their children to step out of the campus and do some social practices. More importantly, the fast-changing society has raised requirements for college graduates. The authorities of Chinese university or college have been encouraging their students to do par-time jobs in the hope that college students would broaden their view and become more adaptable to the future work after they graduate. Therefore, more students go out traveling or doing social practices during the vacations."}, {"QType": "1", "QContent": "    As a college student, I think the chart reflects the exciting progress on the college students\u2019 thinking patterns from freshman to senior.
